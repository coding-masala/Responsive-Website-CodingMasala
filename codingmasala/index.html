                    skilled
                    coders, which in turn leads to a lack of good quality code being produced. This can be seen in the
                    high
                    number of software bugs and vulnerabilities that are found in code. The situation is exacerbated
                    by the fact that there are few incentives for people to learn coding, as there is little demand for
                    it
                    in the job market. As a result, poverty of coding is a problem.</p>
